# Machine Learning - Beginners Guide

This README file contains information about various machine learning methods commonly used in data science and artificial intelligence applications.

## Decision Tree

Decision trees are a type of supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. They partition the feature space into regions and make predictions based on the majority class or average target value within each region.

## Gradient Descent

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function in machine learning models. It iteratively adjusts the model parameters in the direction of the steepest descent of the cost function.

## K-fold Cross-Validation

K-fold cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models. The dataset is divided into k subsets, and the model is trained and evaluated k times, each time using a different subset as the validation set.

## Linear Regression

Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for regression tasks. It models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

## Logistic Regression (Binary Classification)

Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks. It models the probability of a binary outcome using the logistic function and estimates the parameters using maximum likelihood estimation.

## Multivariate Regression

Multivariate regression is an extension of linear regression that models the relationship between multiple independent variables and a dependent variable. It is used for regression tasks with multiple predictors.

## One-Hot Encoding

One-hot encoding is a technique used to convert categorical variables into numerical format. It creates binary dummy variables for each category of the categorical variable, with one variable set to 1 and the others set to 0.

## Random Forest

Random forest is an ensemble learning technique used for classification and regression tasks. It consists of a collection of decision trees, where each tree is trained on a bootstrap sample of the data and makes predictions by averaging the predictions of all trees.

## Support Vector Machine

Support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It finds the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space by maximizing the margin between the classes.

## Train-Test Dataset Split

The train-test dataset split is a technique used to evaluate machine learning models. The dataset is divided into two subsets: the training set, used to train the model, and the test set, used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
